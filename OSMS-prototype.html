    <h2>This is a best-practices guide for local teams and individuals working to produce and distribute open-source PPE and medical devices.</h2>
    <p>This guide is intended to provide help and answer common questions, but should not be seen as rigid, prescriptive or comprehensive. We recognize that the current version is USA-centric; we’re working to translate and localize this guide for teams in other countries.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in joining or creating a local response group, please:
      <ol>
        <li>Read this guide</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions for <a href="">Finding and Creating Groups</a></li>
      </ol>

    <p>THANK YOU for your efforts! Hundreds of thousands of locally-manufactured items have already been delivered to institutions in need (see the OSMS weekly survey results). Local response is evolving daily, and we will be updating this resource guide regularly.</p>

  <div class="section-head"><a name="mission"><h2>Need-to-Know Information: Our Shared Mission and Priorities</h2></a></div>
  <div class="section-body"><p>The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has been classified as a pandemic as it continues to spread globally in an exponential fashion. Significant shortages of necessary medical equipment and supplies are occurring as the demand for these items increases and interruptions in the global supply chain increase exponentially.</p>
    <p>Fundamental supplies facing shortages include personal protective equipment (PPE; e.g. gloves, goggles, surgical masks, face shields, respirators, gowns, and disinfectant) as well as the equipment required to treat critically ill patients, such as ventilators and oxygen concentrators. The lack of supplies poses a threat to both patients suffering from COVID-19 and the healthcare workers treating them.</p>
    <p>OSMS urges makers and professional fabricators alike to utilize their production capabilities to produce the supplies and equipment so desperately needed in the global fight against COVID-19. We are thrilled to have local organizers join us, on the ground, to help fill gaps in the medical supply chain.</p>
    <h3>OSMS exists to meet the following needs, which are integral to our mission:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cataloging and portraying the issues around COVID-19 in a robust way while providing current and accurate information, dispelling misinformation, and maintaining cybersecurity.</li>
      <li>Finding and evaluating open source medical supply solutions and amplifying/sharing them as widely as possible.</li>
      <li>Connecting with relevant communities (i.e. hospital systems in need, fabrication groups, design groups, philanthropy, etc.) and bringing them together to coordinate effectively and resiliently.</li>
      <li>Understanding the prevalence of COVID-19 in real-time to provide accurate statistical insights as a complement to raw data.</li>
      <li>Helping orchestrate local, distributed responses throughout communities around the globe to respond to outbreaks and shortages of necessary medical equipment and supplies through relationship building, communications strategy, marketing initiatives, and the organization of local responders.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>This is a global supply chain crisis. The scale of what is needed is massive.</h3>
    <p>Needs range from hospitals requiring hundreds of thousands of items per day down to vulnerable, individual community members seeking supplies to help them safely conduct their activities of daily living.</p>
    <p>Awareness of these issues varies enormously between different regions, and even different areas in the same region. Many areas (rural hospitals, nursing homes, homeless shelters, etc.) are already without vital supplies, and have been for some time. In other areas, valuable resources continue to be wasted or thrown away due to a lack of awareness around the scale of this issue. Education is a critical component of your local organizing work.</p>
    <p>As regional / local organizers, we need to seek large-scale solutions to the large-scale problems, while at the same time directing small-scale makers to the small-scale projects where they can have a meaningful impact.</p></div>

    <p>As we all work together to tackle COVID-19, there is a need for an open-minded, thoughtful and collaborative response. From our experience the best teams function by embracing a culture where:</p>

            <div class="number-body"><p>When choosing your geographic area of focus, think regionally.

      <h3>This proposed staffing model is not a one-size-fits-all model.</h3>
      <p>Consider this a starting point for tasks your group will need to consider. In most organizations/regions, people work across these roles. As your group grows, you can recruit additional people to take on tasks based on their relevant skills and connections, and roles can become more specialized.</p>

      <h3>As you build your team, we recommend that critical roles be doubled (2 people per role, in separate households) in case of illness or other disruptions.</h3>
      <p>We foresee that as this crisis impacts more and more people personally, individual capacity to volunteer will fluctuate. Plan for this ahead of time and build in both redundancy and clear channels for communication.</p>

      <h3>Your team should not meet in person (unless individuals in your group already are cohabitating)</h3>
      <p>When exchanging supplies or other items, contactless delivery should be used. (High risk individuals should not be part of delivery networks.) You want to be distributed so that if one member of your organization becomes ill, the whole organization is not compromised.</p>

      <p>Again, composition of each organization will be informed by local circumstances as well as talents available.</p>

<div class="section-head"><a name="outreach"><h2>Outreach Guidance</h2></a></div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>This is an especially gratifying time to be a networker. There is a broad understanding of the need for PPE and devices to fight COVID-19, and most people (and their businesses) are motivated and generous if they have an avenue to participate.</p>

    <p>In general, identifying the individuals that are empowered to contribute, drive progress, set new or temporary emergency policies, and extend their network are critical to success. Don’t waste time on avenues that are resistant; work with active collaborators, even in institutions and businesses.</p> 
    <h3>Hospitals</h3>
    <p>Hospitals, especially those with ERs and ICUs, are in critical need of PPE and other medical supplies. Your group can offer help to communicate their needs to (and help mobilize) local/regional manufacturing capacity for collection drives and production.  However, willingness to accept donations or purchase locally-produced PPE and medical devices is absolutely unique to each institution or network.</p>
    <p>There are two relationship paths towards servicing hospitals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Direct: through contact with hospital administrators (“procurement” or “purchasing”).</li>
      <li>Indirect: through organizations such as local or statewide nurses’ unions, via individual healthcare providers who work in a facility.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Hospitals: Direct Outreach</h4>
    <p>Hospitals may be difficult to work directly with because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All hospital equipment and supplies are regulated to ensure standards of quality. This means that even if their PPE inventory might be low and health care providers may not have adequate protection, the institution is hard-pressed to publicly accept and provide PPE and supplies that have not met regulatory requirements (even production facilities need to be compliant and approved).  Read the Safety and Liability section in the <a href="">OSMS Medical Supply Guide</a>.  Liability is why some health care workers are experiencing formal <a href="">reprimands</a> and even <a href="">termination</a> for disclosing lack of adequate PPE.</li>
      <li>The volume of supplies needed can be very high (hundreds of thousands per week).  These needs are often too great to be met by the efforts of individual makers—but can be met in part by a very well organized, distributed production model.</li>
      <li>Many hospitals are currently overwhelmed by COVID-19 response, so they may not have the bandwidth to work with individuals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Recommended Outreach Steps:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Look first on the hospital website to determine what the hospital needs.  Many hospitals are listing what PPE they are accepting.</li>
      <li>Check to see whether the needs of your local hospitals or other medical services are listed in these (and other) online PPE demand/supply exchanges:</li>

      <li>When you call, ask to speak to the Procurement Manager or Supply Manager.</li>
      <li>Make notes in one document (see suggested templates in <a href="#resources">Resources Links</a> below) with the following types of fields:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Name, phone number, email address, and preferred method of contact.</li> 
        <li>Supplies and quantities needed</li>
        <li>If they are open to accepting locally-produced PPE</li>
        <li>What designs they will accept</li>
        <li>Next steps</li>
        <li>Amount delivered</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Identify types and quantities of supplies needed. Record this even if they are requesting supplies you cannot furnish. You can provide this information to other resource-sharing networks.</li>
      <li>Ask if they are working with any major donation drive campaigns (note who they are for follow-up collaboration).</li>
      <p>If no PPE donation drives are happening, consider starting one.  Check in with nurses and medical workers’ unions, as they are known for running donation drives in other cities.</p>
      <li>Ask if they are open to accepting locally-made supplies.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Elicit any information about available supplies and/or patterns that they would like you to use.</li>
        <li>Share the OSMS Design Guide, and point to designs that other hospitals or medical practitioners in the area are using / that you have in production.</li>
        <li>Offer to deliver a physical prototype or sample for their review. Check back for feedback and help to iterate design as requested/able.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Document procedures for notifying the facility that supplies are ready to be dropped off and/or dropoff or mailing procedures. (Your team may need to consolidate distributed production at an intermediary location before coordinating drop off at the facility.)</li>
      <li>Tightly limit access to this information as part of information security practices (see Information Security section).</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Hospitals: Indirect Outreach</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Labor unions that represent nurses and medical workers may be interested in understanding your group’s capacity to provide for their members.  Reach out and build relationships.  They may even be able to help with getting designs approved, as well as distribution.</li>
      <li>Your own personal network—and the collective network of your team— may drive indirect donation of new and locally manufactured supplies.  You may know practitioners in need personally, or see requests by medical for supplies in social media and in neighborhood forums.  Individual doctors, nurses and staff are personally accepting donations, and sharing quantities with colleagues.</li>
      <p>In some communities, volunteer courier services—bicycle messengers and motorcycle clubs—are acting as point to point distribution networks.</p>
    </ul>
    <h4>Civic, Community and Social Servica Organizations</h4>
    <p>Providing PPE to vulnerable community members reduces  transmission and slows the rate at which people present to the hospital.</p>
    <p>These entities are more willing to accept maker-produced PPE and their needs are generally on a scale that is manageable for local production.  Outreach methods are similar  to hospitals above (internet research, social media, cold calling—and recording contact information and needs data as you work).</p>
    <p>Types of organizations and “essential” workers (those that are working in localities with active “shelter in place”-type guidelines) that are in need include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Police departments</li>
      <li>Fire departments</li>
      <li>Urgent care facilities</li>
      <li>Ambulance businesses</li>
      <li>Nursing homes & lifetime care facilities</li>
      <li>Sub-Acute and Long-Term Rehabilitation Facilities</li>
      <li>Social services agencies</li>
      <li>Retail / grocery workers (these have labor unions you can work through)</li>
      <li>Distribution warehouse workers</li>
      <li>Garbage and recycling workers</li>
      <li>Homeless advocacy groups & shelters</li>
      <li>Disability organizations (direct service)</li>
      <li>Funeral homes</li>
      <li>Vulnerable community members [people who need “buddies” for wellness checks, domestic violence organizations, prisoners and other detainees (jails, prisons, ICE detention, etc.]</li>
      <li>Public health departments</li>
      <li>Transit maintenance workers</li>
      <li>Airport workers</li>
      <li>Local donation drives, collecting commercially manufactured PPE and other supplies to distribute to local organizations in need</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Maker and Crafter Community Outreach</h4>
    <p>Local OSCMS groups can help with coordinating efforts, sharing <a href="">OSMS information</a>, and identifying suppliers, volunteers, and donation sites.</p>
    <p>In many communities, distributed manufacturing is delivering large numbers of supplies by coordinating making efforts across individual makers and crafters.  People work at home, in garages and workshops independently, but are coordinated by online collaboration tools such as Facebook Groups, Slack, and custom websites (see <a href="#resources">Resource Links</a> below).</p>
    <h5>Thousands of individuals and crafter groups are mobilizing to sew masks.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Check this <a href="">U.S. directory of sewing organizations</a>.</li>
      <li>These groups have their own individual cultures and ways of operating. In building collaborations with them, it is important to respect the structures they have established and focus on identifying and communicating the value that you are able to provide to them, rather than on attempting to change their overall structures and operational models. (This value could be access to vetted designs, materials, or supplies such as 3D printed bias tape makers.)</li>
      <li>For a more accessible entry point, OSMS has created a <a href="">guide specifically for sewists/crafters</a>.</li>
      <li>We have also created a <a href="">guide for organizing cloth mask donations</a> for additional guidance regarding masks specifically.</li>
      <li>Point makers to OSMS face or surgical masks resource document if additional in-depth information is needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Makerspaces, hackerspaces and FabLabs are operating in many communities to leverage digital fabrication tools to produce PPE and devices</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">Visit the OSMS Design Library for a list of PPE and devices</a></li>
      <li>Guidelines for safe workplace guidelines for social distancing and for sterile working conditions are being developed (see <a href="resources">Resources Links</a>)</li>
      <li>Some helpful indexes for finding these organizations:</li>
      <p>Makerspaces: <a href="">https://makerspaces.make.co/</a></p>
      <p>Nation of Makers member directory: <a href="">https://www.nationofmakers.us/member-directory</a></p>
      <p>International FabLab Network:  <a href="">https://fabfoundation.org/global-community/</a></p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Manufacturer Outreach</h4>
    <p>To address large-scale demands of hospitals, large-scale manufacturing capacity is generally required.</p>
    <p>Conduct outreach to determine what manufacturing/machining/fabrication resources already exist in your area.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are U.S.-based, connect with your state’s manufacturers.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program has a center in every state that is knowledgeable about the local manufacturing presence.  <a href="">Connect with Your Local MEP Center</a> (Or visit the #local-response-connect slack channel and search for “MEP”)</li>
        <li>Check this <a href="">Thomas manufacturers database</a> of “Covid-19 Response Suppliers.”</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Other ways to locate production facilities:</li>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Manufacturers associations </li>
        <li>Local Chamber of Commerce </li>
        <li>City or regional economic development departments</li>
        <li>Industrial design, prototyping and product development houses </li>
        <li>Large companies with local production facilities</li>
        <li>Universities and colleges (engineering, design, business departments are connected to local industry)</li>
        <li>Trade unions</li>
        <li>Machine shops</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="section-body">
    Social media is like a firehose. It will take effort, strategy, and teamwork to manage it effectively. Without care, there is a real risk of accidentally doing harm, whether in the form of individuals testing unsafe ideas, or shooting yourself in the foot because medical facilities lose trust in your organization.

    <p>The OSMS Moderator team has documented their learnings from managing a 60,000+ person member Facebook Group in our Facebook Guide.  Below, an abbreviated version:</p>
    <a href="" class="cta-btn">Read the Full Facebook Guide</a>
    <h3>Use the About section.</h3>
    <p>Articulate your mission and explain who you are.  This is doubly important if you are choosing to run a “private” Group (meaning one cannot see the discussion until one is approved as a member).</p>
    <p>Your About section is also an opportunity to create “signposts” to share immediate information on how prospective community members can get involved and take action.  (Example: <a href="">OSCMS SFBay About</a>)</p>
    <h3>Outline clear rules for participation in your group.</h3>
    <p>You are welcome to take these directly from the central OSCMS group. (You can view the current rules at any time by visiting the <a href="">“About”</a> page and scrolling down.)</p>
    <h3>Have criteria for member approval to screen bots and bad actors.</h3>
    <p>Require incoming members to agree to group rules.</p>
    <p>Ask questions about why members are joining the group and what kinds of connections, expertise, or equipment they may have.</p>
    <p>Watch for recently-created accounts, as these are typically bots.</p>
    <p>Please also watch for postings that are marketing over priced PPE (see <a href="">Information Security</a> below).</p>

    <h3>Minimize the amount of “noise” in your channel.</h3>
    <p>“Pin” essential information to the top in a master post and mark it as an announcement. Edit the post to add extra links as needed. Refresh the post every few days to add new info.</p>
    <p>If your group starts to gain serious momentum and members and posting increase or lower in quality, consider requiring moderator approval for new posts.</p>
    <p>Create master threads to discuss particular topics. Suggested topics include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>introductions thread</li>
      <li>threads for individual types of supplies</li>
      <li>thread for people to share needs that they have learned about</li>
      <li>thread for manufacturers and businesses that want to get involved</li>
      <li>thread for smaller-scale makers and makerspaces to share their capacity, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider posting these topics in advance of inviting others to join your Facebook group so that there is a structure in place to “catch” people as they filter in.</p>
    <h3>Build a strong team of moderators and work to create multiple “shifts” so that the group is not left without moderation for extended periods of time.</h3>
    <h3>Facilitate private communication for moderators outside of the Facebook group.</h3>
    <p>We recommend using Slack for this. If you do this, make sure that you restrict settings so that individual moderators cannot create private channels. Transparency is key.</p>
    <h3>Be vigilant about scams and intentional bad actors.</h3>
    <p>Our Information Security section below will help you identify these types of requests.</p>

  </div>
<div class="section-head"><a name="infosec"><h2>Information Security</h2></a></div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h3>One of the problems with this group’s size and level of public interest is that malicious actors are starting to come out of the woodwork.</h3>
    <p>We have seen fake accounts attempting to sell medical products, people posing as physicians soliciting for donations, and personal information that was shared by well-intentioned members being scraped from posts and spammed relentlessly. There are enormous costs to this, as potential for huge monetary losses also reduces the overall credibility of this movement. Because of these scams, hospital systems may be increasingly resistant to working with you or to viewing your group’s work as safe.</p>
    <p>To help keep you safe, and to protect the integrity of this group, we are adopting a few new policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be vigilant about screening incoming membership requests for bots.</li>
      <li>Be skeptical of posts about buy-ins for large quantities of PPE and/or materials. You are welcome to reach out to the OSMS team (via your the Local Organizing PM’s Slack channel) for assistance with these questions. See Purchasing section.</li>
      <li>If someone says they are connected to (or work for) a particular business, consider asking them to share links from their public web page. Check this against their email address to see if their domain (the part that comes after the @ symbol) matches the public website domain. If there is a mismatch, proceed with caution.</li>
      <li>Be especially wary of anyone who requires a purchase order before verifying the quality of the product. Be vigilant in your efforts to screen for these kinds of posts or messages and ban violators quickly. While there may be a person out there who does have this connection, we cannot verify it and more than likely, this is a scam. For large quantity buy ins, please see the above policy regarding verification.</li>
      <li>Report any post that is perceived as a scam to Facebook for abusing their policies.</li>
      <li>Do not permit individuals to post personal data - email address, phone number, physical address, etc - and remove any that you find. This is to keep our members, and those whose information they may be sharing, safe.</li>
      <li>Any individual who is found to be misrepresenting their affiliation with the OSCMS group should be immediately banned from the group.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>


<div class="section-head"><a name="fundraising"><h2>Fundraising</h2></a></div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h3>Donations and Grants</h3>
    <p>Most local PPE production efforts are currently funded generously by donations.  Donations can be in-kind (e.g. free use of an empty warehouse, large donations of materials), and also cash.</p>  

    <p>In the United States, setting up a method for accepting cash donations is getting very easy.</p>
    <p>Here are some platforms and methods that facilitate fundraising campaigns:</p>
    <li>GoFundMe for individuals/groups and for non-profits/NGOs.</li>
    <li>Facebook fundraising, either for non-profits or for individuals.</li>
    <li>Direct contribution to non-profit via web commerce plugin (example)</li>

    <p>The last bullet above is a good example of how a non-profit makerspace or other organization might fund member and community efforts:  stand up a COVID-19 Relief Fund.  That organization can run a campaign, collect donations, and then make decisions to distribute resources to community efforts as desired. Sharing news on award recipients both instills trust via transparency, and provides deserved praise and attention to worthy efforts.</p>

    <p>A few other scenarios we are seeing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reaching out to local community foundations for emergency grants.</li> 
      <p>One OSCMS received a letter of support from the State Department of Health as well as their local hospitals for a community foundation grant to cover research and development costs for prototypes for various challenges, plus two months of operating expenses.</p>
      <li>Major donor solicitation—reaching out to high net worth individuals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Commerce</h3>
    <p>It’s not unrealistic as an organization - even a non-profit -  to ask for compensation for quality goods from an institution that has budget (and who would be buying if there was traditional supply).  Many institutions are expediting vendor set-up workflows to get the goods they are after.  Don’t be afraid to enquire, but be prepared with pricing and basic business infrastructure—and potentially higher expectations around quality, delivery etc.</p>

    <p>One U.S. OSCMS group worked out a contract with their State Department of Public Health to pay for labor, materials, and overhead for all they are making.</p> 

  </div>


  <div class="section-head"><a name="purchasing"><h2>Purchasing PPE</h2></a></div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>Procurement of PPE and medical devices is a profession. Hospitals have staff dedicated to the vetting of distributors, suppliers, and equipment. Most manufacturing of PPE is in Asia, compounding the challenges of sourcing supply.</p>

    <p>There are many scammers and bad actors trying to take advantage of this current breakdown in the medical supply chain. (See <a href="#infosec">Information Security</a> section above.) Price gouging and counterfeit product (e.g. <a href="">respirators that misrepresent NIOSH certification</a>) are running rampant.</p> 

    <p>In the United States, OSMS is currently referring those seeking to purchase quantities of PPE to Project N95.   This team will help with verification and certification.  <a href="">Here is their due diligence process</a>.  New York residents also have the option to work with <a href="">PPENow</a>.</p>

  <div class="section-body">
    <p>Tracking your community’s output is a wonderful way to motivate the team and communicate to community stakeholders, donors, officials etc the impact your organization is having.</p>
    <p>OSMS is running “weekly counts” in the <a href="">OSCMS Facebook Group</a>. These posts are only live for 24 hours.  Individuals and groups are encouraged to post pictures and quantities of what they have produced that week.  Each week the totals are tallied, designed into a graphic, and shared via social media (here is the <a href="">repository of weekly count graphics</a>).</p>
    <p>As coordinators, your help gathering data on production is critical.  Some inspiration/tools:</p>
